```

### 2. Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key-here"
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12

# Cloudinary (for image uploads)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your-cloud-name"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your-api-key"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your-api-secret"

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NODE_ENV="development"
```

### 3. Database Setup
```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# Seed the database with initial admin user
npx prisma db seed
```

### 4. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Database Configuration
The application uses SQLite by default for development. For production, you can easily switch to PostgreSQL or MySQL by updating the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file and the provider in `prisma/schema.prisma`.

### Image Storage Configuration
Cloudinary is configured for image uploads. You can switch to AWS S3 or other providers by updating the image service in `src/services/image.ts`.

### Authentication Configuration
JWT settings can be customized in `src/services/auth.ts`:
- Token expiration time
- Refresh token strategy
- Password complexity requirements
